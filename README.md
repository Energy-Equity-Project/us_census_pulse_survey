# Pulse Survey Table 4: Energy Use

## Notes on Data
- Taken from US Census Pulse Survey
- Household Pulse Survey (HPS) ended on September 16, 2024, with the final data of the cross-sectional data collection released on October 3, 2024 (data before up to this period contained state level sampling)
- In early October 2024, HPS content began transitioning into a longitudinal design, with data collected every other month to be released at a national level (data unavailable)

# Housing Table 4 – Household Energy Use and Spending in the Last 12 Months, by Select Characteristics

## What Table 4 is and where it sits in every release
“**Housing Table 4 – Household Energy Use and Spending in the Last 12 Months, by Select Characteristics**” is one of the *Housing Tables* issued with every detailed-table release of the Household Pulse Survey (HPS). It reports the **percent of adults** (plus margins of error) who, at least once in the previous year:

| Indicator (question ID) | What it captures | Response categories shown in the table |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HSE11` | Kept the home at a temperature they felt was unsafe or unhealthy to save energy | *Almost every month / Some months / 1–2 months / Never* |
| `HSE12` | Could not pay the energy bill in full | Same four-point scale |
| `HSE13` | Received a shut-off notice for electricity, gas, oil, or other home-heating fuel | Same four-point scale |
| `HSE14` | Actually had service disconnected | Same four-point scale |

Each cycle’s Table 4 breaks those four indicators out **across ~35 “select characteristics”**—income brackets, tenure (owner / renter), race-ethnicity, disability status, presence of children, SNAP receipt, state, and the 15 largest MSAs—using HPS person-level replicate weights so that all percentages represent the U.S. civilian, non-institutional adult population. A companion *Standard Error Table 4* is released side-by-side.

## Timeline – when Table 4 existed

| Phase / Cycle (collection window) | Release date | Status of Table 4 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 3.2, Week 34** (Jul 21 – Aug 2 2021) | 11 Aug 2021 | **First appearance** after HPS added the “Household Energy Insecurity” module |
| Weeks 35–48 (Phase 3.2) and three additional phases (2021–23) | Aug 2021 – Jun 2023 | Table 4 retained; wording unchanged |
| **Phase 4.x (monthly cycles) 01 – 09** | Jan 9 – Sep 16 2024 | Table 4 continued; layout unchanged except minor label updates |
| **Phase 4.2, Cycle 09** (Aug 20 – Sep 16 2024) | 3 Oct 2024 | **Final cross-sectional release**; Census Bureau ended detailed tables when HPS shifted to the longitudinal HTOPS design |
| **2025 – present (HTOPS)** | – | No detailed tables produced, so Table 4 no longer published |

## How the underlying data are produced

* **Sampling & weighting** – Each cycle draws ~100 000 housing units stratified by state and the top 15 MSAs. One adult per responding household completes the on-line questionnaire. Person-level balanced-repeated-replication weights (80 replicates) adjust for non-response and coverage.
* **Frequency & geography** –  
  * **Weeks 0–48 (2021–22):** continuous bi-weekly collections.  
  * **Phase 3.3 onward:** “two-weeks on / two-weeks off.”  
  * **Phase 4.0 onward:** monthly “cycles.”  
  * Each Table 4 provides national totals, **50 states + DC** (Puerto Rico separately), and the **15 largest CBSAs**.
* **File naming conventions** –  
  * Early weeks: ``…/hhp/2021/wk34/housing4_week34.xlsx``  
  * Monthly cycles: ``…/hhp/2024/cycle09/housing4_cycle09.xlsx``
* **Spreadsheet layout** – Columns hold the four indicators; rows list characteristics. Tabs are state abbreviations. Companion SE file reports standard errors to ± 0.1 pp.

## Why Table 4 matters

*It is the only federal time-series that tracks **energy insecurity** at state and metro scales in near-real time.* Researchers and advocates use it to:

* quantify the share of households foregoing other necessities to keep the lights on;
* monitor the impact of fuel-price spikes, extreme-weather shocks, and LIHEAP disbursements;
* identify disproportionate burdens on renters, low-income households, and communities of color; and
* evaluate policy proposals such as shut-off moratoria or bill-payment relief programs.
